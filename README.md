# Docs to HTML Converter

This project is a fork of original [Docs to Markdown](https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html). This project only focus on our need on HTML, that means Markdown is not under supported.

These scripts are working on my account, but still can't figure out how to share this testing add-on to anyone who wish to test it. See this issue [How to publish it for anyone who wants to test and help?](https://github.com/ChrisTorng/gd2md-html/discussions/6) for details.

Below is the original README.md:

# Docs to Markdown (gd2md-html)

Docs to Markdown is a free Google Docs add-on that converts a Google Doc to simple, readable Markdown or HTML text.

## Overview

Docs to Markdown lets you use Google Docs' editing, formatting, and collaboration tools before you publish to a Markdown or HTML platform. Docs to Markdown also lets you select and convert part of a Google Doc.

Docs to Markdown requires minimal permissions: it will ask for permission to access the current Doc (to convert it) and permission to create a sidebar (the user interface). It requires no other permissions.

Use Google Docs styles for headings (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) so that Docs to Markdown can convert them properly to Markdown or HTML heading styles. If you just make them bold and large, they will convert as normal paragraphs.
